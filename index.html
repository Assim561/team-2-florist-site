                    would describe with perfect accuracy the exceptional flowers and plants of eGreen.
                Some say they have healing properties, others say they grant three wishes. Me? I 
            think they just really, really nice plants." - Hans Millionaire </p>

                    For whatever reason, their plants seem to have open my senses to the beauties of
                    oxygen. I haven't had hayfever in 7 years." - Heather Feather.
